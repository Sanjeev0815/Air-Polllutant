SIH Hackathon Proposal

Problem Statement:
Short-term forecast of gaseous air pollutants (ground-level O₃ and NO₂) using satellite and reanalysis data.

Proposed Solution

Develop an AI/ML-based predictive system to forecast short-term concentrations of O₃ and NO₂. The system will leverage satellite data, reanalysis meteorological variables, and historical pollutant measurements to provide accurate forecasts for 1–3 days ahead.

Key Components:

Data Collection:

Satellite-derived O₃ and NO₂ concentrations (Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, MODIS).

Meteorological variables from reanalysis datasets (ERA5, MERRA-2): wind speed, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, etc.

Optional: Ground monitoring data for calibration.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.

Align spatial-temporal resolutions (resample, interpolate).

Feature engineering:

Lag variables of pollutants.

Moving averages and seasonal indicators.

Meteorological interaction features.

Modeling Approach:

LSTM/GRU: Capture temporal patterns in pollutant concentrations.

Random Forest/XGBoost: Use meteorological features for regression.

Hybrid Model: Combine LSTM for time series + Random Forest for exogenous features.

Prediction & Evaluation:

Forecast pollutant levels 1–3 days ahead.

Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R².

Baseline comparison: persistence model (assume pollutant remains constant).

Visualization & Dashboard:

Interactive plots of predicted vs actual values.

Spatial heatmaps for gridded data.

Alerts for high pollution days.

Implement dashboard using Streamlit for hackathon demo.

Innovation & Uniqueness

Combines satellite remote sensing, reanalysis data, and AI for fine-scale forecasting.

Hybrid ML model captures both temporal dynamics and meteorological influences.

Provides real-time actionable insights for citizens and policymakers.

Technologies

Data Handling: Python, Pandas, NumPy, xarray

ML/Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch, Scikit-learn

Satellite & Reanalysis APIs: Google Earth Engine, Copernicus Open Access Hub, NASA Earthdata

Visualization: Plotly, Folium, Streamlit

Methodology

Collect 1–2 years of satellite & reanalysis data for the selected city/region.

Preprocess data: handle missing values, align grids and timestamps.

Engineer features for ML models.

Train LSTM for time-series trends; train Random Forest for meteorological predictors.

Combine predictions in hybrid ensemble.

Evaluate using RMSE/MAE/R²; compare with baseline.

Visualize outputs in an interactive dashboard with maps and time-series charts.

Feasibility

Hackathon-friendly: focus on one city/region.

Limit forecast horizon to 1–3 days.

Use 1–2 years of historical data to train models.

Can generate a demo dashboard within a short timeframe.
